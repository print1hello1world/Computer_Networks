      <p>There are many kinds of risks associated with computer networks, eg, viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, phishing, 
      keylogging, identity theft, online fraud, and Denial of Service attacks. <br>
      <b>Viruses</b> <br> <br> People usually call most malware a virus, but in really, viruses are programs that
      can duplicate and spread themselves onto other computer networks, so a malware program can <u>only</u> be a virus if
      it can spread. <br><b>Worms</b><br><br> Worms are malware that use backdoors to gain access computers and enter through
      them. <br><b>Trojan Horses (Trojans)</b><br><br>Trojan Horses, also referred to as Trojans, are malware programs that 
      are disguised as something good that the user wants to download, like a film or a game. These are quite common on 
      torrenting sites. <br><b>Phishing</b><br><br> Phishing is trying to access sensitive information by disguising as someone
      who should have access to the information. <br><b>Keylogging</b><br><br> A keylogger is a program that tracks every key 
      that you type, and looks for specific combinations, like a 16 digit number and sends everything around it to the person 
      who developed it. Some keyloggers also track and send everything you type, instead of just passwords and credit card 
      numbers. <br><b>Identity Theft</b><br><br> Identity theft is when someone tries to access to your bank account 
      or other accounts by pretending to be you. They can do this by getting a cookie stored on your browser when you go on 
      their website, and using it on insecure websites. <br><b>Online Fraud</b><br><br> Online fraud is when someone steals 
      money from your bank account, usually by getting access to your accounts by Identity Fraud. <br><b>Denial of 
      Service Attacks</b><br><br> NEEDS EDITING FROM HERE
      
      A Denial of Service (DoS) Attack is when someone with a powerful computer sends so much 
      data to a network that it can't cope with it and all of the servers hosted on the network go down. Although a DoS 
      attack can happen from a very powerful computer with a fast network, it usually takes the form of a Distributed Denial 
      of Service (DDoS) Attack, in which a lot of less powerful computers on slower networks all send data to one network in
      order to take it down. DDoS malware can be installed onto a computer without the owner/user knowing/noticing.
