      <p>There are many kinds of risks accossiated with computer networks, eg, viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, phishing, 
      keylogging, identity theft, online fraud, and Denial of Service attacks. <br>
      <b>Viruses</b> <br> <br> People usually call most malware a viruse, but in really, viruses are programs that
      can duplicate and spread themselves onto other computer networks, so a malware program can <u>only</u> be a virus if
      it canspread. <br><b>Worms</b><br><br> Worms are malware that use backdoors to gain access computers and enter through
      them. <br><b>Trojan Horses (Trojans)</b><br><br>Trojan Horses, also referred to as Trojans, are malware programs that 
      are disguised as something good that the user wants to download, like a film or a game. These are quite common on 
      torrenting sites. <br><b>Phishing</b><br><br> Phishing is trying to access sensitive information by disguising as an
      authoritate or official.
Keylogging

A keylogger is a program that tracks every keystroke you type, and looks for specific things, like a 16 digit number and sends everything around it to the person who created it. Some keyloggers also track and send everything you type, instead of just passwords and credit card numbers.
Identity Theft

Identity theft is when someone tries to gain access to your bank account or other accounts by impersonating you. They can do this by getting a cookie stored on your browser when you visit their website, and using it on insecure websites.
Online Fraud

Online fraud is when someone steals money from you from your bank account, etc. via the Internet, usually by getting access to your accounts by Identity Fraud
Denial of Service Attacks

A Denial of Service (DoS) Attack is when someone with a powerful computer sends so much data to a network that it can't cope with it and all of the servers hosted on the network go down. Although a DoS attack can happen from a very powerful computer with a fast network, it usually takes the form of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack, in which a lot of less powerful computers on slower networks all send data to one network in order to take it down. DDoS malware can be installed onto a computer without the owner/user knowing/noticing.
